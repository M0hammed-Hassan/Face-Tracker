# Face-Tracker
This project for tracking the faces by using object detection techniques. VGG16 is a popular convolutional neural network architecture that is commonly used for image classification tasks. To make a face tracker using VGG16, you will need to customize the network to detect faces in real-time video streams.

Here are the general steps you can follow to create a face tracker using TensorFlow and VGG16:

- Collect a dataset of face images and label them appropriately as positive or negative examples.
- Preprocess the face images by resizing and normalizing them to a standardized format.
- Load the VGG16 model into TensorFlow.
- Replace the fully connected layers of the VGG16 model with your own custom layers that are designed for face detection.
- Train the model on the preprocessed face images using a suitable optimizer and loss function.
- Once the model is trained, use it to detect faces in real-time video streams by applying the model to each frame of the video.
